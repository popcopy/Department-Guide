                    <h3>What Is a Loan? </h3>
                    <p>A loan is the cash value plus dividends, less any unpaid loan and accrued interest. Policy
                        owners can borrow using the policy as sole security.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>How a Loan Works </h3>
                       <p> Loans can be processed if the policy contains a loan provision and there is sufficient value for
                        the amount requested. Loan value is a percentage of a policy’s guaranteed cash value plus
                        dividend value. A loan can be obtained from New York Life (NYL) or New York Life Insurance and
                        Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), using the policy as sole security, and does not have to be repaid,
                        however loan interest is due annually. The specific criteria for processing loans are outlined
                        in this procedure. A policy owner may request a cash loan for a specific amount, the maximum
                        amount, a loan exclusive of dividends or a loan to pay premiums on the same or another policy or
                        application, according to their personal preference or needs. Open attachment for more
                            information on <a class="contact-link" href="LoanProcedure.pdf"> Loans...</a>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Effects of Loans</h3>
                    <P>Loans are not taxable events except if the policy is a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  If a policy is a MEC, a loan may result in taxable income if there is a taxable gain on the policy.  If there is gain, the lesser of the gain or the payment becomes taxable. A signed request is required only if a gain exists in the policy. See the FATCA Procedure for details regarding withholding for foreign entity policy owners). <br>
                        A loan will affect the cash surrender value of the policy and its policy proceeds.  If the policy is surrendered, if the policy terminates, or if a Life Insurance Benefit becomes payable under the policy, any outstanding loans (including any accrued loan interest) will be deducted from the cash value of the policy or the Life Insurance Benefit that is paid.
                        </P>
