            <div class="container-one">
                <ol>
                    <li>Loan requests placed in the GO 344 Suspense account may only be requested by the Administrative
                        Manager (AM) or, if the AM is out of the office, the Senior Specialist (SS). All agent requests
                        must come through the AM or SS, who will determine the validity of the request.</li>
                    <li>The AM or SS will secure a current signed and dated loan agreement form and will send an email
                        to the two Values Team managers in Cleveland and Dallas with a copy to the CVPs over the teams
                        in both locations. The email will include a scanned image of the signed loan form with the
                        policy number, amount being requested and whether any taxes will be withheld. The subject line
                        of the email should state, “Same-Day Urgent Loan Request.”
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note: If the agent (or the policy owner) calls the AM and requests an emergency loan for
                                pickup later in the day, the AM can accept the signed loan agreement when the client
                                arrives in the office, assuming the policy is not jointly, corporate- or trust-owned and
                                requires multiple signatures. In this situation, the AM will obtain all necessary
                                information over the phone (policy number, loan amount, taxes withheld). The AM will
                                send an email to the Values Team managers advising that the loan request is verbal and
                                provide the necessary information. The AM will be responsible for sending the loan form
                                to DMS.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Values Team manager will review the email, check to make sure the request is from the AM or
                        SS, forward the email to AWF and copy in one of the Values Team analysts for review and
                        processing.</li>
                    <li>The Values Team analyst will review the status and available loan value on the policy. If the
                        request is in good order, the loan will be processed, and funds deposited into the GO’s 344
                        Suspense account under the policy number. (If the request is in good order and submitted before
                        2:00 pm CST, the loan will be processed the same day.)
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note: In the event that the request cannot be processed because proper requirements were
                                not submitted, e.g., the policy is collaterally assigned and appropriate documentation
                                was not provided, the Values Team analyst will reply back to the AM, with a copy to the
                                Values Team manager, explaining why the request is NIGO and what requirements are
                                necessary in order to process the loan transaction.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If the request is in good order, the Values Team analyst will process the loan and then reply to
                        the AM, with a copy to the Values Team manager, advising that the loan has been processed and
                        the funds are available in GO Suspense.</li>
                    <li>The AM or SS will process the check for the client and secure the appropriate identification
                        prior to releasing the check to the client. The check is not to be given to the agent to deliver
                        to the client.</li>
                    <li>The AM or SS does not have to request Zone approval in advance; however, they should advise the
                        Zone Administrative Officer of the loan transaction.</li>
